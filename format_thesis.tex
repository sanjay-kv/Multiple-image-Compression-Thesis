\begin{doublespacing}
{\large\noindent The world is Digitizing day by day, so the expectations for highest Quality contents in budget range is increasing. So Technique such as Image Compression System is Relevant.
The research area of image compression provides many widely-used compression methods that provide relevant back-ground and a basis of comparison for our application.
Image compression schemes can be divided into two categories:
•	Lossless compression and
•	Lossy compression.
Lossless compression allows the exact input signal to be reconstructed after it is compressed.
Lossy Image compression reduces the image fidelity, when an image is compressed at low bitrates. Thereby reduction in Quality is seen

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\label{chap:intro}
\section{Overview}
 \ac{SI} is typically an inverse process whereby structural parameters such as stiffness, damping properties are identified from input excitation and output responses.
 

 Generally, Engineering problems can be classified into forward and inverse problems \citep{ssikoh}. In forward problems, the system output responses are calculated from the known system properties and input responses as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fp} whereas in inverse problems, the system parameters are identified based on the input and output responses of the system which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ip}.

  \caption{Inverse problem}
  \label{fig:ip}
  \end{figure}
  For a structure, the input excitation is a periodic force and the output responses are displacement, velocity and acceleration. The input force can be measured using force transducer and the output responses can be measured respectively using vibration pick-ups, velometer and accelerometer. Some \ac{SI} algorithms require measurement of all responses or any one of the output responses. Since the input and output responses are measurable for a structure with unknown parameters, the \ac{SI} problem is an inverse problem which identifies structural or damage parameters.\\ \vspace{-5mm}

 \chapter{LITERATURE SURVEY}


\section{Image Compression Survey}
\citet{george} showed that the magnitude of change in natural frequencies is a function of the severity and of the location of deterioration in structures. The modal analysis has been carried out on a welded steel frame and a wire rope with damage. \citet{gredia} proposed a direct method for determining six flexural stiffnesses of a thin anisotropic plate. In this method, natural frequencies \citep{Leo} and mode shapes have been processed using \ac{LS} technique.

\chapter{VECTOR ALGEBRA}
\section{Product of Two Vectors}
\label{app:vp}
The product of two vectors are may be a scalar product or vector product. The scalar product of two vectors is also called as dot product. It is defined as $\vec{a} . \vec{b}=|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|cos\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$\\

the cross product or vector product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space and is denoted by the symbol $\times$. The cross product $\vec{a}\times\vec{b}$ of two linearly independent vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is a vector that is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them. 
\chapter{MATRIX ALGEBRA}
\section{Matrix Multiplication}
Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that takes a pair of matrices, and produces another matrix. Numbers such as the real or complex numbers can be multiplied according to elementary arithmetic. On the other hand, matrices are arrays of numbers, so there is no unique way to define multiplication of matrices. As such, in general the term ``matrix multiplication'' refers to a number of different ways to multiply matrices.
